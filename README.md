# 📦 Decentralized File Storage Payments

## 📝 Project Description

This project implements a basic smart contract to facilitate payments between users and storage providers in a decentralized file storage system. It allows users (clients) to initiate storage deals and release payments once data has been successfully stored.

## 🌍 Project Vision

Our vision is to create a secure, trustless, and efficient payment layer for decentralized storage systems. By using blockchain technology and smart contracts, we aim to eliminate the need for centralized intermediaries and ensure fair compensation for storage providers.

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **Trustless Deal Creation**: Clients initiate deals by paying upfront.
- 💸 **Manual Payment Release**: Clients confirm successful storage before releasing funds.
- 🛠️ **Minimal & Gas-Efficient**: Only essential functions included.

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Add **file hash verification** using IPFS or similar protocols.
- Implement **auto-payment via storage proof**.
- Introduce **dispute resolution mechanisms**.
- Build a **frontend DApp** for easier interaction.
- Support **ERC-20 tokens** instead of native ETH.
